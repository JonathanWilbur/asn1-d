## ISO 6093 Compliance

I do not have a copy of ISO 6093, nor am I willing to spend about $60 to
get a 12-page, heavily-padded document describing in farcically formal
terms how to write numbers. If you want to pay for this so I can ensure
my library is compliant, be my guest.

## Comparison Testing

### PyASN1

Using the outputs of PyASN1, I implemented unit tests for each of the three
X.690 codecs. This library produces similar outputs, to PyASN1, and decodes
PyASN1's outputs correctly.
