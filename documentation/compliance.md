Note that non-conformance to the specification does not mean that this library
actively defies the specification, but rather, that it cannot be guaranteed to
meet the specification. In most cases, the specification can be met by building
upon the library.

For instance, the specification for encoding `OBJECT IDENTIFIER`s mandates that
the encoded element be primitively constructed, but this library does not stop
you from marking the element as constructed. To meet the specification, you as
a developer simply must _not_ set it as constructed.

## ISO 6093 Compliance

I do not have a copy of ISO 6093, nor am I willing to spend about $60 to
get a 12-page, heavily-padded document describing in farcically formal
terms how to write numbers. If you want to pay for this so I can ensure
my library is compliant, be my guest.

## Comparison Testing

### PyASN1

Using the outputs of PyASN1, I implemented unit tests for each of the three
X.690 codecs. This library produces similar outputs, to PyASN1, and decodes
PyASN1's outputs correctly.
